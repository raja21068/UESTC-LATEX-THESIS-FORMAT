An efficient, secure and transparent distributed electricity market system can be realized by integrating various technologies like internet of things, energy internet and blockchain. The blockchain technology is revolutionizing the world through  numerous applications in various fields ranging from electric power systems and transportation to healthcare systems. Blockchain, a secure, efficient, transparent and tamper proof distributed system, which can provide authentic, immutable log and transaction records in a network, is excelling in the  transactive energy market and renewable energy systems for electricity trading. Recently, application of blockchain technology in  transactive energy market for electricity trading has become prevalent both in industry and academia. In this context,  blockchain features smart contracts, information exchange, financial transactions, and energy trading by storing the data in a shared ledger, which is pivotal for distributed power systems. The purpose of this paper is to review the energy blockchain development in distributed power and energy  market. In this paper, the types of blockchain technology, consensus algorithms, and smart contracts for peer-to-peer energy market are categorized. Moreover, this work provides a perspective on the transformation of traditional market into the next-generation market by blockchain technology. Finally, this work provides an overview of various kinds of objective functions and solution approaches used in the power market to achieve optimal goals.
\section{Introduction}\label{S_Intro}

Conventionally, electricity \add{is} mainly generated from large centralized power plants powered by non-renewable fossil fuels \cite{boroojeni2016theoretical}. \revise{The higher }{higher }The higher contribution of conventionally generated electricity is not only accelerating global warming but also increases energy losses in power transmission system \cite{silvente2015rolling}. The aforementioned problems can be solved by increasing the proliferation of renewable energy sources (RES) in the existing energy mix. Increased proportion of the RES will mitigate the environmental problem and change the consumer oriented market to prosumer oriented market. However, it will make the energy system more complex due to their inherent intermittency issues. Prevalent wholesale markets are not capable to respond in accordance with the intermittent power generation from RES \cite{monacchi2016assisted}. Furthermore, such markets do not incorporate local availability or scarcity of energy while deciding the prices. Microgrids provide an opportunity for small scale distributed RES to trade energy locally. The realization of microgrid markets necessitates safe and smart information system for their appropriate operation \cite{schleicher2012renewables}.
